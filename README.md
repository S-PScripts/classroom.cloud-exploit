# classroom.cloud-exploit
This exploit is for people that have the classroom.cloud extension. This was found by one of my friends. <br>

## Instructions:
1. During school, go to the Settings app. <br>
2. Go to the "System preferences" section. <br>
3. In the Date and Time section, click "Time Zone". <br>
4. Change the option from "Set automatically" to "Choose from list". <br>
5. Choose a time zone that would be a time that's not school hours. (choose the early times or late times compared to your time) <br>

## How this works:
-> During school hours, the extension will show as "Available". <br>
-> When you are not in school hours, the extension will show as "Out of hours". <br>
-> When "Out of hours", teachers are unable to use the extension to do anything to your Chromebook (such as viewing it or locking it). <br>
-> Since this extension uses your device's clock, changing the time zone can change the status of the extension. <br>

## Notes: 
-> This most likely works with the NetSupport extension too, considering that they're both by the same developers (NetSupport) and have most of the same features. <br>
